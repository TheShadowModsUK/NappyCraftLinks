### Warning Messages
NappyCraft follows the Regression scene and disable scene, the Regression/Roleplay side we follow Regressia a much more friendly 
and clean Role Play ideals for regression, within this Regressia believes showing off Nappies/Diapers in public to be as kin to 
showing off your underwear, TheShadowModsUK agree with this and even though Minecraft Servers need the end user to click and join
said server and can't see it without going in we felt it right to warn new users that Nappies/Diapers will be viewabled on the 
given server you was requested to view this message from.

NappyCraft does not agree with users abusing other users with there regression, and we try our best to keep our mod clean and fun
for all users, If you have any problems with a server using NappyCraft not been PG13 or SFW and they are promting our mod please let
us know.

You should only see the message in game once
