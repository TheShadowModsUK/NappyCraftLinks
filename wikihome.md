### What Is NappyCraft ?
üìñ NappyCraft is a mod that enables roleplaying as a user whom needs nappies/diapers or as an baby within the Minecraft world. Why? many reasons, one it helps some people to relax to be younger again, some users in real life wear nappies/diapers for medical reasons and been able to wear in game might also make them feel welcomed or able them to joke about their problems, NappyCraft gives you the user the option to create and wear a range of nappies/diapers this also means to change them nappies/diapers, there is wetting functions if you drink from the provided baby bottle or via the /wet command.


### Will there be bowel movement functions ?
üìñ I can't believe I have to even comment on this but NO if you have incontinence you will know and understand how wrong this option would be in the game, it does not promote health role play, it does not help anyone feel accepted, nappies/diapers might be apart of your wardrobe but messing is a very unhealthy thing to be doing willingly and we can't and will not support this function now or later, any add-ons created for NappyCraft including this function will not be supported in any shape or form and using them isn't advised. Another update to why this wont be added, this isn't PG and wouldn't be suitable for children from the age of 10, this is the age mods and content in Minecraft must now target. 


### Who is this mod for ?
üìñ NappyCraft is for whom ever wants it, if you don't like the mod simple don't download it and don't user it, if it's on a server you're on, just don't make them or wear them, Minecraft is about playing your game your way, so don't let anyone change your story within Minecraft.

The main people we aim our mod to is people whom have incontinence and regression therapy so people can wear nappies in a safe place or feel accepted.

### Can I remove the Nappy/Diaper Buffs?
This is now a yes, as of <span style="color:red;">1.0.7.3</span> a new game rule as been added** doNappyBuffs** what is enabled by
default but you can do <span style="color:yellow;">***/gamerule doNappyBuffs***</span> false and it will disable the buffs offered by the
**nappies**/**diapers** this will not remove the curse of binding this is there for a good reason and never
will be removed and any addons doing this might even be black listed by our mod.

**Note**:
The binding is there as A balance mechanic, it's also there to stop users from abusing the armor
in dispenser's trick what could create not disabled or willing regression users to be bullied to wear
a **nappy**/**diaper** on a given server. it also helps regression users to simulate needing extra steps
to be changed showing them it's not all fun and games to regress and also lets the disabled people
whom are using nappies to still cope with there illness to feel that we have taken this limitation in to
account and not just made wearing a big joke.


### How do I see/know the recipes ?   

‚ùì It seems a few users are brand new to Minecraft modding and to you guys I welcome you and they
keep asking about recipes, well it seems üåê[JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) sometimes miss some recipes what are not normal crafting table recipes so have created a list on the left under [Recipes](https://theshadowmodsuk.com/modwiki/nappycraft/2.-recipes), this list should be updated but üåê[JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) is still recommended.

I advice you to use üåê[JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei), reason I say this is that's the one I have tested our mods with, when you press
E or at the Crafting Table with üåê[JEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei) installed you will get a large list of items, in the box at the bottom
right type **@NappyCraft** to find all the **NappyCraft** [recipes](https://theshadowmodsuk.com/modwiki/nappycraft/2.-recipes).
